a pomodoro timer - The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, 
from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

This just a graphical timer with some pep.
